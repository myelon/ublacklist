# uBlacklist Anti-Facebook Filter List

This repository contains a filter list specifically designed for the [uBlacklist](https://github.com/iorate/uBlacklist) browser extension, aimed at blocking Facebook-related domains from appearing in search results. The list has been converted from "[Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List](https://github.com/ryanbr/fanboy-adblock/blob/master/fanboy-antifacebook.txt)". It's made for anyone who wishes to prevent Facebook domains from cluttering their search results (including Google, Bing, Brave, and DuckDuckGo).

## Features
- **Blocks main Facebook domains and its related subdomains.**
- **Simple to integrate with the uBlacklist extension.**
- **Converted and optimized for search result blocking.**
