# UBlacklist Anti-Facebook Filter List

This repository contains a filter list specifically designed for the [ublacklist](https://github.com/iorate/uBlacklist) browser extension, aimed at blocking Facebook-related domains from appearing in search results. The list has been converted from the renowned "Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List" which is tailored for Adblock Plus. It's ideal for users who wish to prevent Facebook domains from cluttering their search results without affecting on-page content.

## Features
- **Blocks main Facebook domains and its related subdomains.**
- **Simple to integrate with the UBlacklist extension.**
- **Converted and optimized for search result blocking.**

> **Note**: While this list prevents specific domains from appearing in search results, it does not act as an on-page content filter. It's mainly designed to provide a clutter-free search experience.
